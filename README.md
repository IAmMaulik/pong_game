### Hello Everyone
# This is a fun Pong game I made
I made this in python using the pygame library. 
It was a really fun project and I really learnt a lot by making this project.

## Point to note: 
- I you use Visual Studio Code as your IDE, you should copy the line in the settings.json file and paste in your user settings. It is to disable pylint and will help you to get rid of the useless squiglly lines that VSCode makes while using pygame.

## Hope you enjoy
